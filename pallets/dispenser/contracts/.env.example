# Ethereum Deployment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values
# NEVER commit .env to version control

# ======================
# Required Configuration
# ======================

# Deployer private key (without 0x prefix or with it, both work)
# This account needs ~1.15 ETH for deployment + initial funding
# Generate: cast wallet new
# Import: cast wallet import --interactive
PRIVATE_KEY=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# MPC-controlled Ethereum address
# This address will be authorized to call fund() on the GasFaucet
# CRITICAL: Verify this is correct - cannot be changed without redeploying
MPC_ADDRESS=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# Ethereum RPC URL
# Mainnet examples:
#   - Infura: https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
#   - Alchemy: https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY
#   - QuickNode: https://YOUR_ENDPOINT.quiknode.pro/YOUR_TOKEN/
# Testnet (Sepolia): https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com
RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY

# ======================
# Optional Configuration
# ======================

# Etherscan API key for contract verification
# Get one at: https://etherscan.io/myapikey
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY

# Chain ID (usually auto-detected from RPC)
# Mainnet: 1
# Sepolia: 11155111
# CHAIN_ID=1

# ======================
# Deployment Parameters
# ======================
# These are configured in script/Deployment.sol
# Listed here for reference only - edit Deployment.sol to change them

# MIN_ETH_THRESHOLD=0.1 ether      # Minimum ETH reserve in faucet
# INITIAL_FUNDING=1 ether          # Initial ETH sent to faucet
# SALT_VOUCHER=keccak256("GAS_VOUCHER_V1")
# SALT_FAUCET=keccak256("GAS_FAUCET_V1")

# ======================
# Post-Deployment
# ======================
# After deployment, save the addresses here for reference

# GAS_VOUCHER_ADDRESS=0x...
# GAS_FAUCET_ADDRESS=0x...

# ======================
# Security Notes
# ======================
# 1. NEVER commit this file with real values
# 2. Use hardware wallets (Ledger) for mainnet deployments
# 3. Consider using a multisig as owner after deployment
# 4. Rotate and secure private keys after deployment
# 5. Verify all addresses before deploying to mainnet
