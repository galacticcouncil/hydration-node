# EVM accounts pallet

## Terminology

* **Truncated address:** * A substrate address created from an EVM address by prefixing it with "ETH\0" and appending
  with eight 0 bytes.
* **Full Substrate address:** * Original 32 bytes long native address (not a truncated address).
* **EVM address:** * First 20 bytes of a Substrate address.

## Overview

The pallet allows users to bind their Substrate account to the EVM address and to grant a permission to deploy smart
contracts.
The purpose of this pallet is to make interaction with the EVM easier.
Binding an address is not necessary for interacting with the EVM.

### Binding

Without binding, we are unable to get the original Substrate address from the EVM address inside
of the EVM. Inside of the EVM, we have access only to the EVM address (first 20 bytes of a Substrate account).
In this case we create and use a truncated version of the original Substrate address that called the EVM.
The original and truncated address are two different Substrate addresses.

With binding, we store the last 12 bytes of the Substrate address. Then we can get the original
Substrate address by concatenating these 12 bytes stored in the storage to the EVM address.

### Smart contract deployment

This pallet also allows granting a permission to deploy smart contracts.
`ControllerOrigin` can add this permission to EVM addresses.
The list of whitelisted accounts is stored in the storage of this pallet.

### Approving smart contracts

This pallet is also used to control which contracts are allowed to manage balances and tokens.
`ApprovedContract` storage is used by the currencies precompile to determine whenever contract is allowed to transfer or
not.

### Dispatchable Functions

* `bind_evm_address` - Binds a Substrate address to EVM address.

* `remove_contract_deployer` - Removes a permission of whitelisted address to deploy smart contracts.
* `renounce_contract_deployer` - Renounce caller's permission to deploy smart contracts.
* `approve_contract` - Approves contract address to manage balances.
* `disapprove_contract` - Disapproves contract address to manage balances.
